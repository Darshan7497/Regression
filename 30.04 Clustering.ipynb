    "Not Informative for Some Data: In cases where clusters overlap significantly or have irregular shapes, the Silhouette Coefficient might not provide meaningful insights.\n",

    "Lack of Absolute Threshold: The Silhouette Coefficient does not have a fixed threshold to determine whether a clustering solution is good or bad. Interpretation often relies on comparing values across different solutions or datasets.\n",
