    "The role of feature selection in anomaly detection is to identify and choose the most relevant and informative attributes (features) from the dataset that are essential for distinguishing between normal and anomalous data points. Feature selection helps improve the efficiency and effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms by reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most discriminative attributes. This process aids in improving the accuracy of anomaly detection, reducing computation time, and mitigating the \"curse of dimensionality.\"\n",

    "By selecting the right features, the anomaly detection algorithm can work more efficiently, capture the underlying patterns of anomalies, and avoid being influenced by irrelevant or redundant attributes.
