    "Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, where a change in the independent variable leads to a proportional change in the dependent variable. The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a simple linear regression example using the relationship between the number of hours studied (independent variable) and exam scores (dependent variable). We collect data from a group of students, where we measure their study hours and corresponding exam scores. The simple linear regression model will estimate the line of best fit that represents the relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by considering more than one independent variable to predict a dependent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and multiple independent variables, allowing for the analysis of the combined effects of these variables on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to predict house prices based on various factors such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Multiple linear regression allows us to consider all these independent variables simultaneously to predict the dependent variable, which is the house price. The model estimates the coefficients for each independent variable, representing their respective contributions to the house price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, simple linear regression involves one independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables. Simple linear regression is appropriate when there is a single predictor of interest, while multiple linear regression allows for the analysis of multiple predictors and their combined effects on the dependent variable."

    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data for accurate and reliable results. These assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. This means the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables. To check this assumption, scatter plots or correlation matrices can be used to visualize the relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset are assumed to be independent of each other. There should be no correlation or dependence among the residuals or errors. This assumption can be checked by examining the residuals for any patterns or correlation.( residuals refer to the differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the predicted values from the regression model.  Residual = Observed Value - Predicted Value)\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent. Plotting the residuals against the predicted values can help assess this assumption. If there is a cone-shaped pattern or a fan shape, it indicates heteroscedasticity, violating the assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. The normality assumption can be checked by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and comparing them to a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Multicollinearity: The independent variables should be independent of each other. There should be no high correlation between the independent variables. To check for multicollinearity, correlation matrices or variance inflation factor (VIF) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Endogeneity: The error term should not be correlated with the independent variables. If there is endogeneity, it suggests omitted variables or model misspecification. To identify endogeneity, a thorough understanding of the data and subject matter expertise is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, various diagnostic techniques can be used, including residual analysis, visual inspection of plots, statistical tests, and examining model performance metrics. It is important to assess these assumptions to ensure the validity of the linear regression analysis and to make appropriate interpretations of the results."

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the loss function of a model. It is commonly used in training machine learning models, particularly in cases where the model parameters cannot be computed directly using a closed-form solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of gradient descent revolves around finding the minimum of a function by iteratively updating the parameters in the direction of steepest descent. It starts with an initial guess of the parameter values and then iteratively adjusts them by taking steps proportional to the negative gradient of the function. The gradient represents the direction of the steepest increase in the function, so moving in the opposite direction (negative gradient) allows us to descend towards the minimum.\n",

    "Compute the gradient: Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. The gradient indicates the direction and magnitude of the steepest ascent in the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the parameters: Update the parameters by taking a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient. This step size is controlled by a learning rate, which determines how big the updates should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat steps 2-4: Repeat the process of computing the loss, calculating the gradient, and updating the parameters until convergence or a specified number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iteratively adjusting the parameters based on the negative gradient, gradient descent gradually finds the optimal set of parameters that minimizes the loss function. It is an iterative process that converges towards the minimum of the function, allowing the model to learn and improve its performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different variants of gradient descent, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent, which differ in how they update the parameters and use the training data. These variants offer different trade-offs in terms of computational efficiency and convergence speed, depending on the size and nature of the dataset.\n"

In linear regression, the relationship is assumed to be linear, meaning that the change in the dependent variable is directly proportional to the change in the independent variable(s).
