    "Eigenvalues: An eigenvalue of a square matrix is a scalar that represents how the matrix stretches or compresses space.

Eigenvalues provide information about the scaling factor along the eigenvectors' directions.\n",

In other words, when the matrix is applied to the eigenvector, the result is a scaled version of the original eigenvector. Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that satisfy the equation Av = λv, where A is the matrix, v is the eigenvector, and λ (lambda) is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",
