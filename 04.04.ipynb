    "The Decision Tree Classifier algorithm is a popular supervised learning method used for classification tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the features' values, ultimately creating a tree-like structure to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Decision Tree Classifier algorithm works to make predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Splitting: The algorithm starts with the entire dataset, which contains a set of input features and their corresponding target labels (classes or categories). It looks for the feature that best splits the data into subsets, aiming to maximize the homogeneity of the target labels within each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Node: The first feature selected becomes the root node of the tree. The root node represents the entire dataset and acts as the starting point for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal Nodes: From the root node, the algorithm creates \"internal nodes\" based on other features to split the data further. Each internal node represents a decision based on a specific feature and its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: The tree branches lead to \"leaf nodes,\" which are the final outcomes or predictions. Each leaf node corresponds to a specific class label. The tree keeps branching out until it reaches leaf nodes that represent the final classification for each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Making: At each internal node, the algorithm makes a decision by comparing the feature value of the data point being evaluated. Depending on whether the condition (e.g., \"Is the feature value greater than 5?\") is met or not, the algorithm follows the corresponding branch to another internal node or leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting Criteria: The Decision Tree algorithm uses various criteria to determine the best feature and value for splitting the data at each internal node. Common criteria include Gini impurity and entropy, which measure the impurity or disorder within subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning (Optional): After creating the entire tree, the algorithm may apply pruning techniques to reduce the tree's complexity and avoid overfitting. Pruning involves removing some branches or nodes that do not significantly improve the model's performance on the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: Once the tree is constructed, the algorithm can use it to classify new data points. Starting from the root node, it follows the decision path based on the features' values until it reaches a leaf node, which represents the predicted class label for the new data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree classifier is known for its interpretability and ease of visualization, as it creates a straightforward flowchart-like structure to represent the decision-making process. However, it may be prone to overfitting, especially if the tree is too deep and captures noise in the data. Techniques like pruning and setting a maximum tree depth can help address overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability to new, unseen data."

The goal is to create a tree-like structure that can efficiently separate the data into different classes based on the input features. Let's go through the key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree classifier uses a splitting criterion to determine which feature and value to split the data. Common criteria include Gini impurity and entropy.\n",
    "Gini impurity measures the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly classified according to the distribution of the target classes in the subset.\n",
    "Entropy measures the level of uncertainty or disorder in the subset with respect to the target classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the Best Split:\n",
    "For each feature, the algorithm considers different values as potential split points and calculates the impurity or entropy of the resulting subsets.\n",
    "The feature and value that result in the lowest impurity or entropy are chosen as the best split point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Splitting:\n",
    "Once the best split point is found, the data is partitioned into two subsets based on the selected feature and value.\n",
    "The algorithm then applies the same process to each subset, finding the best split point at each level, and further partitioning the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping Criteria:\n",
    "The recursive splitting process continues until certain stopping criteria are met. Common stopping criteria include a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of samples required to split a node, or a minimum decrease in impurity or entropy after the split.\n",
    "These stopping criteria prevent the tree from growing too deep and overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Nodes and Class Labels:\n",
    "When the recursive splitting process stops, leaf nodes are created. Each leaf node represents a class label, and the majority class in the corresponding subset is assigned as the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification:\n",
    "Once the tree is constructed, classification of a new data point involves traversing the tree from the root node to a leaf node, following the decision path based on the features' values.\n",
    "The final prediction is the class label associated with the leaf node reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

By selecting the best split points based on the splitting criteria and applying recursive splitting, the algorithm efficiently separates the data into different classes."

    "Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate): Recall measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances among all actual positive instances. It is essential when false negatives have severe consequences. In medical diagnoses, false negatives may result in missed detections of diseases.\n",
