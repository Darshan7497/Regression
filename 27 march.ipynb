    "The concept of R-squared (R²) in linear regression models is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target variable) that can be explained by the independent variables (predictor variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by taking the ratio of the sum of squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable to the sum of squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable. It is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the independent variables do not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable, and 1 indicates that the independent variables perfectly explain the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared represents the goodness of fit of the regression model. It tells us how well the model fits the observed data points. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit, as it means that a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, R-squared has its limitations. It does not tell us whether the independent variables are statistically significant or whether the model is well-specified. Therefore, it is important to consider other statistical measures and diagnostic tests in conjunction with R-squared to evaluate the overall performance and validity of the linear regression model."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors (independent variables) in a regression model. While R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the predictors, adjusted R-squared adjusts this value based on the number of predictors and the sample size.\n",

Adjusted R-squared accounts for this by adjusting the value based on the number of predictors and the sample size.\n",

    "Overfitting prevention: Adjusted R-squared is effective in mitigating the risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model excessively fits the training data but performs poorly on unseen data.

    "The key difference between Lasso regularization and Ridge regularization (L2 regularization) lies in the penalty term added to the cost function. In Lasso regularization, the penalty term is the absolute sum of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda or alpha). In contrast, Ridge regularization uses the squared sum of the coefficients.\n",

    "The effect of Lasso regularization is that it forces the coefficients of certain features to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. This means that Lasso can effectively eliminate less important features from the model, making it more interpretable and reducing the risk of overfitting. On the other hand, Ridge regularization can shrink the coefficients towards zero but does not force them to be exactly zero, keeping all features in the model but with reduced impact.\n",
